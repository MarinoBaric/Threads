/*
 üß™ Objective:
Simulate an elevator being used by multiple people (threads).
Each person (thread) calls the elevator, waits for it, and enters one at a time.
The elevator has a maximum capacity of 1 person at a time.

üìù Instructions:
Create a class called ElevatorSimulation.

Inside the class:

Define a shared method enterElevator(String personName) which:

Prints: "Person X is entering the elevator..."

Sleeps for 300 ms (to simulate elevator ride)

Prints: "Person X has exited the elevator."

Use synchronized(lock) to allow only one thread inside the elevator at a time.

In the constructor:

Create and start 4 threads representing people: "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"

Each person calls enterElevator(...) once

Use join() on all threads

After all threads are done, print: "All passengers have exited the elevator."

/*
Alice is entering the elevator...
Alice has exited the elevator.
Bob is entering the elevator...
Bob has exited the elevator.
Charlie is entering the elevator...
Charlie has exited the elevator.
Diana is entering the elevator...
Diana has exited the elevator.
All passengers have exited the elevator.


üí° Key Concepts Reinforced:
Shared resource (elevator)

synchronized block with lock

Thread creation and management

Simulating delay with Thread.sleep
