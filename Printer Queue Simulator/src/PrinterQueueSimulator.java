/*
 üß™ Objective:
Simulate a printer queue where 3 users (threads) send print jobs to a shared printer.
The printer can only print one job at a time, and each user sends 5 print jobs.

üìù Instructions:
Create a class named PrinterQueueSimulator.

Define:

A shared method print(String userName, int jobId) that simulates printing by sleeping for 500 ms.

A private Object lock = new Object();

In the constructor:

Create and start 3 threads, each representing a user: "User A", "User B", "User C".

Each user (thread) should loop 5 times and try to print:

Call print() with its user name and current job ID.

Use join() on all threads.

After all jobs are printed, print: "All print jobs completed."

        public void run() {
            for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
                print(name, i);
            }
        }

/*
User A is printing job 1...
User A finished printing job 1.
User C is printing job 1...
User C finished printing job 1.
User B is printing job 1...
...
All print jobs completed.

üí° Tips:
In print(), use synchronized(lock) so that only one thread can access the printer at a time.

Sleep inside print() to simulate printing.

Use a loop in each thread to simulate 5 jobs.
